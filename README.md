# Phrase Hunters Game

This is a command-line game built in Python where the player has to guess a phrase by guessing individual letters. The game displays a phrase as a series of underscores, and the player has to guess letters one at a time. If the player guesses a correct letter, it is displayed in the phrase. If the player guesses an incorrect letter, the letter is diplayed above the phrase. The game ends when the player guesses the phrase or makes five incorrect guesses.

## How to Play

1. The game will display a welcome message and a blank phrase with underscores representing the letters.
2. The player has to guess a letter by entering it at the prompt.
3. If the letter is in the phrase, it will be displayed in the phrase.
4. If the letter is not in the phrase, a part of a hangman will be drawn.
5. The player has to keep guessing letters until they guess the phrase or make five incorrect guesses.
6. If the player guesses the phrase, they win the game.
7. If the player makes five incorrect guesses, they lose the game.
8. After the game ends, the player can choose to play again or quit.
